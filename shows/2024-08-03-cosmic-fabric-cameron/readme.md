## Title

The Cosmic Fabric Model | Sitdown with Cameron Ward

August 3, 2024 (interview date)


:0)


## Chapters / Description

What is SPACE? What if it's actually a 'something'?! Come join me in this chat with a really smart guy, Cameron Ward, who's pursuing a dissertation on this fascinating topic. Einstein, general relativity, spacetime, ... really simple stuff eh?! I want to thank Cameron for doing this first sitdown ("interview") on this channel, hopefully the first of many with some fellow creationists.

See Dr. Ticho Tenev's dissertation on the Cosmic Fabric Model, which model Cameron is expanding upon, here: https://www.proquest.com/openview/0ef583596a27a3be05d1eb7ac25becb8/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y

Housekeeping: Pardon me for the audio! Due to "technical difficulties" of my own making, Cameron's audio, which was fine on its own, got but put through a digital meat grinder :0) We did our best to recover it.

For the audience to get a little aquintained with relativity, in my view still as valid as ever is R. Humphreys' Starlight and Time:

- Ticho did acknowledge: "Baumgardner, Russ Humphreys... offered unfiltered feedback and from the beginning were a source of inspiration and encouragement"

Extra notes:

 Demystifying relativity (32:29)
  * “functional structure implies design”
  * “but the cosmos man was not given dominion over… but we observe it glorifying God”
  * the functional design of the universe and the well design purpose of observability (33:21)

General relativity + materials science (41:12)
  * “the equations of General Relativity were derived from continuum mechanics. Again you wouldn’t expect those to go together. But it literally came from a standpoint of mechanics”
  * “materials science related to astrophysics…”

How gravity slows down ‘fabric time’ (59:40)
  * “there’s a rate at which matter to matter interactions can take place…” - that ultimately is what the speed of light is about!
  * deforming the sheet (with an object that bends this fabric) “changes the property of the sheet, that’s going to change how fast the wave can (propagate)”

  * “but here’s the deal: if you were (to) change the rate at which two particles of matter could interact with one another, with this straining that’s taking place on the sheet, what does that mean? It literally means that you’re slowing down time” (NP: the 'local time' that is of creatures that live in that part of the fabric)

 * “so if you have strain, and you were pulling this sheet - were doing deformation on it - there’s elastic stretching that’s taking place, THAT’S GOING TO MAKE THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PARTICLES SLOWER” (1:00:32)

## Notes on Ticho's diss

* Ticho: "An elastic constitutive model of spacetime and its applications"

* https://www.proquest.com/openview/0ef583596a27a3be05d1eb7ac25becb8/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y

    - elastic?
    - constitutive?

> The behavior of physical space is identified with that of a material-like medium called “cosmic fabric,” which exhibits constitutive behavior.

* how is "a material-like medium" different from fields?

* CONSTITUTIVE: intrinsic, inherent, integral, essential...

> This cosmic fabric is a solid hyperplate that is broad in the three ordinary spatial dimensions and thin in a fourth hyperspatial dimension.

Key words there:

1. solid
2. hyperplate
3. 3D makes sense, but "thin in a fourth hyperspatial dimension"
    - hyperspace: identical to Russ H's 'hyperspace', inside the 'baloon' depiction?

    - hyperspace: seems EXTREMELY important, is this core to Einstein's GR as RH said? Just in the equations? NOT just something Ticho et al made up?

    - thin?! in our talks you said exceeding thin, Planck length?!

> Matter in space is treated as fabric inclusions that prescribe in-plane (three-dimensional) strain causing the transverse bending of the fabric into the fourth hyperspatial dimension.

WOW!

> The linearized Einstein-Hilbert action, which governs the
dynamics of physical space,...

* "Einstein-Hilbert action" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Hilbert_action field equations, complex stuff

> is derived from postulating Hooke's Law for the fabric...

Hooke's law [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke's_law):

> In physics, Hooke's law is an empirical law which states that the force (F) needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance (x) scales linearly with respect to that distance

> and the Schwarzschild metric is recovered from investigating matter-fabric interactions

Wow again, is this saying GR is deduced from normal materials engineering math ("solid mechanics")?

Beautiful dedication quote from Ticho:

> DEDICATION: To the Lord Jesus Christ through Whom all things were made and without Whom nothing was made that was made. In Him we live and move and have our being.

> p 2: The unstrained cosmic fabric need not be flat, but could, for example (p3), have global curvature and local relief, which is what we mean by “inherent structure.”
